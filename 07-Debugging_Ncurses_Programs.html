   <a name="ncurses"><h2>Ncurses</h2></a>

   <p>
      Activities like printing characters to a screen, moving the cursor, and changing the color of character output are
      collectively known as <em>screen handling</em>.  By its nature, screen handling is very terminal dependent, however, the
      terminfo and termcap mechanisms were devised to provide terminal independent screen handling.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curses">curses</a> library
      (a pun on the term "cursor optimization") was created to provide a screen handling API for C programmers.  The goal of curses
      was to provide a fast, portable, and terminal independent C API to handle device dependent terminal codes.
   </p>

   <p>
      Curses has a very long and twisted history.  However, the most commonly used modern implementation of the library is
      called <em>new curses</em>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ncurses">ncurses</a>, for short.  Ncurses is a GNU project released under an MIT style licence and is used under nearly all modern Unixes including GNU/Linux, and macOS.  There are now many extensions to ncurses which includes panels, menus and even a full featured widget set: the <a href="http://www.vexus.ca/products/CDK">Curses Development Kit</a> (CDK).

      Compile and run the program.  It should fill your console (or xterm) with
      characters.  It has a bug though: the top row and first column seem to be
      devoid of characters:
   </p>

   	<img src="inclusions/images/buggy_ncurses_output.png" alt="Buggy ncurses program output" />
   </center>

   <p>
      Since the probability of that happening is miniscule (and gets smaller with each passing second), there must be a bug in
      the program.
   </p>

   <p>
      You need to do a bit more to use GDB with a program that uses ncurses.  The problem is that GDB's I/O is intermixed with
      the program's I/O.  Once you get used to it, this is not normally a problem.  But when the program performs screen handling,
      it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to keep track of your debugging session.  To see this in action, start GDB on the
      executable, set a breakpoint at <code>Print_A_Character()</code>, and run the program.
   </p>

   <pre class="code">
   <code>
      $ gdb debugging_ncurses
      (gdb) break Print_A_Character
      Breakpoint 1 at 0x80486fd: file debugging_ncurses.c, line 26.
      (gdb) run
      Starting program: code/ncurses/debugging_ncurses

      Breakpoint 1, Print_A_Character () at debugging_ncurses.c:26
      26              int x = Irand(1, COLS);
   </code>
   </pre>


   <p>Now issue <code>continue 50</code> a few times.  You should see a big mess.  Here's what I see:</p>

   <center style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
   	<img src="inclusions/images/ncurses_mess.png" alt="Image of ncurses mess" />
   </center>

   <p>
      Quit GDB when you've had enough.  Clearly, we need a way to separate GDB's I/O from the program's I/O when screen handling
      is done.
   </p>

   <a name="separatingtheinput/output"><h2>Separating the Input/Output</h2></a>

   <p>
      You'll need two terminals (either two consoles or two xterms): One for the program's I/O and another for GDB's I/O.
      Separating out the two I/O will resolve the problem nicely.  I'll be using the word `xterm', but the same thing applies to all
      non-login terminals like rxvt and eterm, and login terminals like virtual consoles.
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>
         Go to the first xterm and find its device file using either <code>tty</code> or <code>who am i</code>.  This will be the xterm
         with GDB's I/O.:
      </li>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ tty
      /dev/pts/1
      $ who am i
      p        pts/1        May 26 12:44 (:0.0)
   </code>
   </pre>


   <li>Go to the second xterm and find its device file.  This will be the xterm with our program's I/O:</li>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ tty
      /dev/pts/4
   </code>
   </pre>

   <li>Go back to the first xterm and start a debugging session.  Set a breakpoint at <code>Print_A_Character()</code>.</li>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ gdb debugging_ncurses
      (gdb) break Print_A_Character
      Breakpoint 1 at 0x80486fd: file debugging_ncurses.c, line 26.
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <li>
      GDB's <code>tty</code> command instructs GDB to redirect the program's I/O to another terminal.  The argument to <code>tty</code>
      is the device file of the terminal you wish the program I/O to go.  In this case, I want the program's I/O to go to the second
      xterm, <code>pts/4</code>.  If you're following along, use whatever device file you obtained in step 2:
   </li>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) tty /dev/pts/4
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <li>
      Lastly, go to the second xterm (that contains the program's I/O) and tell the shell to sleep for a long time.  This is so
      that anything we type in that window will be sure to go to our program rather than the shell.  The amount of time is
      arbitrary, but pick a time that's longer than you suspect the debugging session will last.  This tells the shell to "do
      nothing" for 100000 seconds:
   </li>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ tty
      /dev/pts/4
      $ sleep 100000
   </code>
   </pre>

   <li>
      Go back to the first xterm which is running GDB and debug to your heart's content.  When you're done, you can go back to
      the program output window and slap it with a control-c to break out of the sleep.
   </li>

   </ol>

   <a name="debuggingncursesexample"><h2>Debugging Ncurses Example</h2></a>

   <p>
      Let's go through a sample debugging session of <code>debugging_ncurses.c</code>.  The problem was that the first row and column
      aren't being printed to.  At first guess, we might suspect that the random number generator is at fault.
