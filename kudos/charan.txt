Subject: GDB Tutorial Corrections and Suggestions

   Sir,
   At the outset let me thank you for the amazing tutorial that you have
   written. I have been using it for teaching and learning GDB for over two
   years now. When I first came across it, it was in my college (local)
   web-site where they had directed us to your tutorial on the web, and had
   an old cached copy here on our site. Some time later I needed to access it
   and had only the web to look to. Then, I came to the official site and
   found that it has been upgraded both in terms of looks and contents!

   One suggestion is why dont you keep a tar or zip file so that people can
   download your tutorial and use it offline?

   By the way, now, my blog has a link to your amazing tutorial. My blog is
   at http://sricharan-log.blogspot.com
   The link to the post regarding your tutorial and other useful links is at

   Keep up the yoemen work, sir.

   Here are some of the observations I made while going through the latest
   version of the tutorial. It took me two days to go through most of this. I
   did not go through the Ncurses section in great detail though. You can
   find the detalied list of corrections that came to my notice in the text
   file attached with the mail.

   Thanking you once again.

   Regards,
   Sri Charan K.
