Subject: Debugging With GDB HOWTO (LDP)

Hi Mr. Salzman,

I was seeking for a document in The Linux Documentation Project about
debugging with gdb. After a good look in the guides directory and in
the HOWTO's, I realized that there was no good document.

After some googlin' I found your document (Using GNU's GDB Debugger)
and found it very enlightening. I think it's a shame that this kind of
document doesn't exist in the Linux Documentation Project.

But in the free world, does who doesn't have initiative doesn't enjoy
the freedom. Based on that, I'm thinking in adapting your text to fit
in a "Debugging With GDB HOWTO". The credits would be all yours, I was
just going to adapt the text to their model.

Please tell me what you think about this idea. I'm working to increase
the amount of documents about development int the LDP, most HOWTOs are
configuration tips, and I think there should be more documentation
helping people to start developing for the community. If you know or
have other documents (GPL of course) in this area please let me know.

Thank You for your time and patience,

FÃ¡bio Luiz
