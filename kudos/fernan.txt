Hello Peter,

thanks for one more nice and informative text. 

Sorry for not answering sooner. We've got a tough course to give, one in
which your gdb documentation gave a good help.

Concerning your question of why LaTeX, the answer is: your material is so
nice and deep that it would be interesting to have it printed -- i guess
webpages are better for short texts.

Since printing HTML is (at least for me :(( ) a lottery, could you please
suggest a browser (or any other tool) that produces good printed pages
when applied to your documentation ?

Best regards,
Hilton

P.S.: please follow me in our intercultural moment. :)

My grandparents were from Spain, so  "hola" really applies to me. 
However, in Brazil people speaks Portuguese and we´re not as familiar to
Spanish as we should.  Unfortunately, that includes myself: my Spanish is
very rudimentar, more like Portunol; our analog to Spanglish here. :)

The informal compliments here are "Oi", similar to "hi"; or "Ola'!", a
literal translation of "Hello!"  More modern compliments can also be "E
ai'!", that we can think of as similar to "what's up?" That if Bugs Buny
is still modern. :) A really modern spelling would be "E ae?" -- that's
the one teenage bloggers use.

That ends (this is a promise :))) our intercultural moment.
