Peter,

Thanks a lot for the awesome gdb tutorial. I just started reading it
yesterday and it is very interesting. I am thoroughly enjoying it. Thanks for
taking the time to write it.

I had a couple of comments.

1. The questions in the exercises were very useful. Do you have the answers
   somewhere so that I can check if I did right.

2. The stack frames section displayed storage space for two int's in the
   frame for the second_function(), even though there was only one integer
   variable in the function. I would have thought that only space for 1
   integer need be allocated.

Please let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Thanks a lot
Rayees Shamsuddin

Peter's note:
1. Unfortunately, I don't have answers written down.  It's on my TODO list.
2. Yep, you found a mistake.  It has been corrected.  Thanks!!!
