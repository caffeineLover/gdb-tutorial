Hi,

I would like to use your GDB guide (http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/)
as the basis for a GDB tutorial I will be instructing a few times
this year.

It would be really nice to have a printable version of it,
but the HTML link for that does not work for me.

So, if you can part with a current copy in printable form,
I'd really appreciate it.  Odds are good that any feedback
received from the tutorial sessions will be fed back to you
(from me) for further improvements.

Please let me know, one way or another, today if possible

Cheers
