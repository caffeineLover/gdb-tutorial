Subject: GDB missing links

Hi Peter Jay Salzman,

Sir, I was reading the document at http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/
I find missing links for some the source C example in the document.

I am Just a novice in programming and with physics background.
I would like to make the document more user friendly for practical usage
but would take some time to get some good understanding of things
running.

Regards
Ram
