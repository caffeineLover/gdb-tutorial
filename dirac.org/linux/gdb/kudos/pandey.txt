Subject: Great Tutorial!

   Hello,

            My name is Vihan and i'm a final year IT engineering student in
   Mumbai, India. i was just going through your article on GDB and i have to
   say it is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! i especially like the fact that you took so
   much pain to explain so many operating system concepts and teaching their
   practical relevance with respect to GDB. In fact i'm going to cite you and
   your GDB tutorial in my references section of a document i'm currently
   writing. Incidently its being written in LaTeX, i'm a LaTeX fan too!

   After visiting your GDB page i checked out other stuff on dirac.org very
   impressive stuff you certainly are a man of many talents :-)

   There is something i do wish to tell you which you may like - one pizza
   lover to another. i visited Italy about 8 years ago and they server
   pizza's both  on a pan(the conventional way) and as a roll, i.e they just
   make a small pizza roll it up, put a tissue around it and give it you.
   Another interesting thing is that in Italy they do not consider pizza as
   junk food. In fact they classify it as a gourmet meal - something classy
   and sophisticated. i haven't seen this anywhere else in the world not in
   Asia, Europe or Australia. Unfortunately i did not take any pictures of
   the pizza itself, if see such a sight again i will certainly forward the
   pictures to you. :-)

   Keep up the good work!

   Regards,

   - vihan
