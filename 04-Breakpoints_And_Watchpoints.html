<h2>Breakpoints, Watchpoints, and Catchpoints</h2>

   <p>
      So far you know how to list source code and run a program from within gdb.  But you already knew how to do that
      <em>without</em> gdb.  What else does gdb give us?  To do anything really useful with gdb, you need to set breakpoints which
      temporarily pause your program's execution so you can do useful debugging work like inspecting variables and watching the
      program's execution in an atomic line-by-line fashion.  This right here is the magic of a symbolic debugger.
   </p>

   <p>Breakpoints come in three flavors:</p>
   <ol>
   <li>
      A <strong>breakpoint</strong> stops your program whenever a particular point in the program is reached.  We will discuss breakpoints
   	momentarily.
   </li>
   <li>
      A <strong>watchpoint</strong> stops your program whenever the value of a variable or expression changes.  We'll discuss watchpoints
   	later on in this chapter.
   </li>
   <li>
      A <strong>catchpoint</strong> stops your program whenever a particular event occurs.  We won't discuss catchpoints until I get a chance
   	to write about them.
   </li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      A breakpoint stops your program whenever a particular place in the program is reached.  Here are some examples of what a
      breakpoint does:
   </p>

   <p>Mr. Computer, won't you please stop when...</p>
      <ul>
         <li><em>you reach line 420 of the current source code file?</em></li>
         <li><em>you enter the function <code>validateInput()</code>?</em></li>
         <li><em>you reach line 2718 of the file <strong>video.c</strong>?</em></li>
      </ul>

   <p>
      All those requests have one thing in common: they ask gdb to stop based on reaching some location within the program.  That's
      what a breakpoint does.  There are two things I'd like to mention before we start:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li><strong>What does "stopping at line 5" mean?</strong>
   	<p>
         When gdb stops at "line 5", this means that gdb is currently waiting "between" lines 4 and 5.  Line 5 hasn't executed yet.
   	   Keep this in mind!  You can execute line 5 with the <code>next</code> command, but line 5 has not happened yet.
      </p>
      </li>
   <li><strong>Why did gdb stop here?</strong>
   	<p>
         Sometimes you may be surprised at where gdb stops.  You may have specified a breakpoint at line 5 of the source code, but
      	gdb could stop at line 7, for instance.  This can happen for 2 reasons.  First, if you compile a program with optimization
      	set, some lines of source code may be optimized out of existence; they exist in your source code, but not in the executable.
      	Secondly, not every line of source code gets compiled into machine code instruction.  See the section on "until" (<strong>FIXME:</strong>
      	when I write it).  Consider the code below:
      </p>
   </li>
   </ol>

   <pre class="code">
   <code>
   1   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   2
   3   int main( void )
   4   {
   5        int i;
   6        i = 3;
   7
   8        return 0;
   9   }
   </code>
   </pre>

      <p>Inserting a breakpoint at line X makes your program pause at line Y...</p>

   	<table border="1">
   	<tr><td colspan="2">unoptimized code</td><td colspan="2">optimized code</td></tr>
   	<tr><td>Breakpoint at line   </td><td>Program pauses at line</td><td>Breakpoint set at line</td><td>Program pauses at line</td></tr>
   	<tr><td>1--4, <code>main()</code></td><td>4                     </td><td>1--4, <code>main()</code> </td><td>4                     </td></tr>
   	<tr><td>5, 6                 </td><td>6                     </td><td>5--9                  </td><td>9                     </td></tr>
   	<tr><td>7, 8                 </td><td>8                     </td><td>                      </td><td>                      </td></tr>
   	<tr><td>9                    </td><td>9                     </td><td>                      </td><td>                      </td></tr>
   	</table>


   <p>
      Each breakpoint, watchpoint, and catchpoint you set is assigned a number starting with 1.  You use this number to refer to
      that breakpoint.  To see the list of all breakpoints and watchpoints you've set, type <code>info breakpoints</code> (which can be
      abbreviated by <code>i b</code>.  I show a sample resulting output:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
   	(gdb) info breakpoints
   	Num Type           Disp Enb Address    What
   	1   breakpoint     keep y   0x080483f6 in main at try5.c:4
   			  breakpoint already hit 1 time
   	2   breakpoint     keep n   0x0804841a in display at try5.c:14
   			  breakpoint already hit 1 time
   	3   hw watchpoint  keep y   i
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      According to the output, there are two breakpoints, one at line 4 and the other at line 14 of the source code.  They are
      assigned to numbers 1 and 2 respectively.  There is also a watchpoint set: the program will halt whenever the variable
      <code>i</code> (local to <code>display()</code>) changes value.
   </p>

   <p>
      In addition to being assigned a number, each breakpoint and watchpoint can be <em>enabled</em> or <em>disabled</em>.  A
      program's execution won't stop at a disabled breakpoint or watchpoint.  By default, when you create a new breakpoint or
      watchpoint, it's enabled.  To disable the breakpoint or watchpoint assigned to number <code>n</code>, type:
   </p>

   <code class="demo">disable n</code>

   <p>To re-enable this breakpoint or watchpoint, type:</p>

   <code class="demo">enable n</code>

   <p>If you look at the sample output of <code>info breakpoints</code> above, you'll see that breakpoint 2 has been disabled.</p>

   <a name="breaking"><h2>Breaking</h2></a>

   <p>
      Compile and run the fgets program, which is a multi-filed program (the files are <a href="./code/fgets/fgets.c">fgets.c</a>,
      <a href="code/fgets/fgets.h">fgets.h</a>, and <a href="code/fgets/main.c">main.c</a>:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ gcc -c -g -W -Wall fgets.c main.c
      $ gcc -o fgets fgets.o main.o
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      Note that the compiler generated a warning.  That's because we used <code>-W -Wall</code> which instructs gcc to tell us when it
      sees what it thinks might be a common programming error.  The best way to debug your program is to not put the bugs in the
      program to begin with.  You should <em>always</em> use these gcc bug finding options.  Let me be blunt here, and I hope I don't
      offend anyone.  It's stupid not to use <code>-W -Wall</code> when you compile code.  Plain and simple.  Stupid.  With a capital S.
      Most people don't use them, even people who are clearly better programmers than me.  That's because even smart people can do
      dumb things.  Don't you be dumb.  Always use <code>-W -Wall</code>.
   </p>

   <p>
      The program is a password guessing program.  Take a moment to look through the code to see how it works.  The program is
      ultra-simple so we can focus on learning GDB rather than trying to figure out complicated code like linked lists and whatnot.
      You should be able to deduce how the program works (and what the password is) in under a few seconds.  Now run the code and
      notice it simply doesn't work.  We'll first concentrate on learning how to set breakpoints, and then we'll debug the program.
   </p>

   <a name="settingbasicbreakpoints"><h3>Setting Basic Breakpoints</h3></a>

   <p>There are four major ways to set a breakpoint, in roughly the order that I personally use them.:</p>

   <ol>
      <li>By function name.</li>
      <li>By line number.</li>
      <li>By filename and line number.</li>
      <li>By address.</li>
   </ol>

   <a name="byfunctionname"><h4>By Function Name</h4></a>

   <p>We've already seen the most common way of setting a brekpoint: with the function name.</p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ gdb fgets
      Using host libthread_db library "/lib/tls/libthread_db.so.1".
      (gdb) break main
      Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048464: file main.c, line 6.
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      The "<code>break main</code>" command sets a breakpoint at the top of <code>main()</code>, which happens to be line 6 of
      <strong>main.c</strong>.  If we now run the program, the program will stop at line 6.  Recall from the previous discussion that this means
      that GDB will be sitting between lines 5 and 6.  Line 6 will <em>not</em> have executed until we issue the <code>step</code>
      command:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) run
      Starting program: code/fgets/fgets

      Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:6
      6               char *word = "password";
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <a name="bylinenumber"><h4>By Line Number</h4></a>

   <p>
      A second way of setting breakpoints is with a line number.  The line number refers to the file GDB is currently in.  Right
      now, we're in <strong>main.c</strong>, so line numbers are with respect to that file for now.  Let's set a breakpoint at line 9, where the
      <code>printf()</code> statement is.
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) break 9
      Breakpoint 2 at 0x804846b: file main.c, line 9.
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      GDB has a <code>continue</code> command which we haven't seen yet.  Once GDB pauses due to a breakpoint, the <code>continue</code>
      command will resume execution.  Use <code>continue</code> to make sure that GDB pauses at line 9:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) continue
      Continuing.

      Breakpoint 2, main () at main.c:9
      9               printf("I'm thinking of a word.  Let's see if you can guess it.\n");
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <a name="byfilenameandlinenumber"><h4>By Filename And Line Number</h4></a>

   <p>
      A third way of setting breakpoints is with a filename and line number, separated with a colon.  Let's set a breakpoint at
      line 10 of <strong>fgets.c</strong>.
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
      (gdb) break fgets.c:10
      Breakpoint 3 at 0x80483fd: file fgets.c, line 10.
      (gdb)
   </pre>

   <a name="byaddress"><h4>By Address</h4></a>

   <p>
      A fourth way of setting breakpoints is with a memory address within the process's VM space.  I'll find the address of
      <code>TakeGuess()</code> and set a breakpoint at that address:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) print TakeGuess
      $1 = {int (const char *)} 0x80483f4 &lt;TakeGuess&gt;
      (gdb) break *0x80483f4
      Breakpoint 4 at 0x80483f4: file fgets.c, line 7.
   </code>
   </pre>

   <a name="breakpointnumbers"><h3>Breakpoint Numbers</h3></a>

   <p>
      You might have noticed that each breakpoint is given an integer identifier.  For example, we've set 4 breakpoints already,
      and the last one we set (by address) was assigned the number 4.  If you haven't noticed this, go back and take a look.  Various
      operations can be performed on a breakpoint, like removing them.  You can perform an operation on a particular breakpoint by
      referring to its integer identifier.
   </p>

   <a name="removingbreakpoints"><h3>Removing Breakpoints</h3></a>

   <p>Just as you can set breakpoints, you can also remove them.  There are numerous ways to remove a breakpoint:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>If you want to remove the breakpoint by its location, use <code>clear</code>.</li>
      <li>If you want to remove the breakpoint by its identifier, use <code>delete</code>.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>So let's use clear to remove the four breakpoints the way we set them; kind of like "undoing" what we did:</p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) clear *0x80483f4
      Deleted breakpoint 4
      (gdb) clear fgets.c:10
      Deleted breakpoint 3
      (gdb) clear 9
      Deleted breakpoint 2
      (gdb) clear main
      Deleted breakpoint 1
      (gdb)
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      The <code>delete</code> command deletes breakpoints by identifier, as opposed to <code>clear</code> which removes breakpoints based
      on their location.  In fact, <code>delete n</code> deletes the breakpoint with identifier <code>n</code>.  We investigate this command
      more fully in the exercises.
   </p>

   <h4 class="exercise">Exercises</h4>

   <ol class="exercise">
      <li>
         If you've been following along with the tutorial, you shouldn't have any breakpoints set since we deleted them all with
      	<code>clear</code>.  Set three breakpoints wherever you like by the methods of your choice.  Before you do, guess what their
      	identifiers will be.
      </li>
      <li>
         Use <code>delete</code>, not <code>clear</code>, to remove only the last breakpoint you set.  This will leave you with two remaining
   	  breakpoints.
      </li>
      <li>
         You should have two breakpoints left.  <code>delete</code> with no arguments removes <em>all</em> breakpoints.  Try it out, then
   	  quit GDB.
      </li>
   </ol>


   <a name="enabling,disabling,andignoring"><h3>Enabling, Disabling, And Ignoring</h3></a>

   <p>
      Once set, there are only two ways to get rid of a breakpoint: remove it or quit GDB.  GDB will continually break at the
      breakpoint.  However, you'll sometimes find it useful to temporarily disable a breakpoint, that is, you do <em>not</em> want GDB
      to break at the breakpoint, but you want to keep the breakpoint there in case you need to debug that section of code again.
   </p>

   <p>
      Breakpoints can be enabled and disabled.  Simply put, your program will pause at an enabled breakpoint, but it will not pause
      at a disabled breakpoint.
   </p>

   <p>
      You can enable or disable breakpoints using the <code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> commands which take an argument of the
      breakpoint identifier for the breakpoint you want to enable or disable.  Let's take a look at this using the <strong>fgets</strong>
      program that we previously used.  Start a debugging session of <strong>fgets</strong> and place two breakpoints at lines 6, 9, and 12 of
      <strong>main.c</strong>:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      $ gdb fgets
      (gdb) break 6
      Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048464: file main.c, line 6.
      (gdb) break 9
      Breakpoint 2 at 0x804846b: file main.c, line 9.
      (gdb) break 12
      Breakpoint 3 at 0x8048477: file main.c, line 12.
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>Disable breakpoint 2, run the program, and use <code>continue</code> to verify that breakpoint 2 does not pause execution.</p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) disable 2
      (gdb) run
      Starting program: code/fgets/fgets

      Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:6
      6               char *word = "password";
      (gdb) continue
      Continuing.
      I'm thinking of a word.  Let's see if you can guess it.

      Breakpoint 3, main () at main.c:12
      12              while ( KeepGoing )
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      Confirmed, breakpoint 2 is disabled.  Finally, enable breakpoint 2 and rerun the program.  Use <code>continue</code> to verify
      that breakpoint 2 now pauses execution:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) enable 2
      (gdb) run
      The program being debugged has been started already.
      Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

      Starting program: /www/p/linux/gdb/code/fgets/fgets

      Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:6
      6               char *word = "password";
      (gdb) continue
      Continuing.

      Breakpoint 2, main () at main.c:9
      9               printf("I'm thinking of a word.  Let's see if you can guess it.\n");
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>Confirmed, once enabled, breakpoint 2 again pauses execution.</p>

   <h4 class="exercise">Exercises</h4>
   <ol class="exercise">
      <li>
         The <code>disable</code> command permanently disabled a breakpoint until you explicitly enable it with <code>enable</code>.
      	However, it's possible to temporarily disable a breakpoint.  Use GDB's help utility to read about the <code>ignore</code>
      	command, which disables a breakpoint "for n crossings".
      </li>
      <li>
         Personally, I don't use ignore a whole lot.  It seems like conditional breaking makes <code>ignore</code> not very useful, but
      	you should still know of its existence.  Hopefully you have GDB still open.  Use <code>ignore</code> to disable breakpoint 3
      	(the one at line 12) for 3 crossings.  Verify that it works.
      </li>
   </ol>

   <a name="listingbreakpoints"><h3>Listing Breakpoints</h3></a>

   <p>
      So far, we've seen three commands that take a breakpoint's identifier as an argument: <code>delete</code>, <code>enable</code>, and
      <code>disable</code>.  There are many others, which we'll cover later.  The point is, breakpoint identifiers are useful, and you'll
      find yourself using them quite a bit.  But how do you remember the identifiers for your breakpoints, or even where your
      breakpoints were set to begin with?  There's a command, <code>info breakpoints</code> which lists all your breakpoints, their
      identifiers, and lots more information.  Hopefully, GDB is still open from the previous subsection, so check it out:
   </p>

   <pre class="demo">
   <code>
      (gdb) info breakpoints
      Num Type           Disp Enb Address    What
      1   breakpoint     keep y   0x08048464 in main at main.c:6
              breakpoint already hit 1 time
      2   breakpoint     keep y   0x0804846b in main at main.c:9
              breakpoint already hit 1 time
      3   breakpoint     keep y   0x08048477 in main at main.c:12
   </code>
   </pre>

   <p>
      This is a very important command, and I find myself using it all the time.  It should be completely self explanatory except
      for a couple of things:</p>

   <ol>
      <li>The <code>Num</code> field gives the identifier.</li>
      <li>
         The <code>Type</code> field gives the type of breakpoint.  There are different types of breakpoints, like hardware watchpoints,
      	which we'll cover shortly.
      </li>
      <li>
         The <code>Disp</code> field (short for disposition) describes what will happen to the breakpoint the next time it's activated
      	(the next time it pauses execution).  <code>keep</code> indicates nothing will happen to the breakpoint, however, it's possible
      	to disable or even remove a breakpoint the next time it's reached.  These situations are identified by the <code>Disp</code>
      	field.
      </li>
   </ol>
