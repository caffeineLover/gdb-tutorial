    <p>
        In the last chapter we learned about an executing process's memory layout which is divided into
        segments.  One important segment is the <em>call stack</em> (or <em>stack</em>), which is a collection
        of <em>stack frames</em> (or <em>frames</em>).  There is one frame for each function call, and the frame
        holds three important things:
    </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The local variables for the function.</li>
            <li>The current address pointer within the function.</li>
            <li>The arguments passed to the function.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        When a function is called, a new frame is allocated and added to the stack.  When the function
        returns, its frame is returned back to unused stack memory and execution resumes at the address
        pointed to by the previous function's current address pointer.  We can ask GDB to tell us what the
        stack looks like with the <code>backtrace</code> command.  We can also find out which frame GDB's
        context is in using the <code>frame</code> command.  Lastly, we can change GDB's context to the
        <code>n</code>'th frame using the <code>frame n</code> command.
    </p>

    <p>
        Executables don't contain references to object (function and variable) names or source code line
        numbers.  It would be painful to debug a program without these things, so to debug a program, we
        generate an augmented symbol table using gcc's <code>-g</code> option.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, we briefly learned how to make GDB pause execution using the <code>break</code> command and
        execute one line of source code using the <code>step</code> command.  We'll have much more to say about
        these commands shortly.
    </p>

    <a name="wherearewegoingtogo"><h2>Where Are We Going To Go?</h2></a>

    <p>
        In this chapter, we'll investigate the <code>list</code> command which (surprisingly) lists lines of
        source code.  We'll take an in-depth look at GDB's initialization file <strong>.gdbinit</strong>.  Lastly,
        we'll look at GDB's <code>run</code> command which executes a program from within GDB.
    </p>

    <a name="basiclistingofsourcecode"><h2>Basic Listing of Source Code</h2></a>

    <p>
        Download <strong>derivative</strong>, a program that calculates numerical derivatives, to follow along with
        the discussion: <a href="./code/03/derivative/broken/derivative.tar.bz2">derivative.tar.bz2</a>.  Take a moment to familiarize
        yourself with the code.  Note the use of groovy function pointers.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can list source code with GDB's <code>list</code> command, abbreviated by <code>l</code>.  Run GDB on
        the executable and use the <code>list</code> command:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    $ gdb driver
    (gdb) list
    12    }
    13
    14
    15
    16    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    17    {
    18        double x, dx, ans;
    19        double Forw, ForwDelta, Cent, CentDelta, Extr, ExtrDelta;
    20
    21        if (argc != 1) {
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        By default, GDB always lists 10 lines of source code.  When you first issue <code>list</code>, GDB
        lists 10 lines of source code centred on <code>main()</code>.  Subsequent use of <code>list</code> gives the
        next 10 lines of source code.  Try it:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) list
    22        printf("You must supply a value for the derivative location!\n");
    23        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    24    }
    25
    26    x   = atol(argv[1]);
    27    ans = sin(log(x)) / x;
    28
    29    printf("%23s%10s%10s%11s%10s%11s\n", "Forward", "error", "Central",
    30        "error", "Extrap", "error");
    31
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Use <code>list</code> three more times, and you'll see:</p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
         ... <em>output suppressed</em>

    45            printf("dx=%e: %.5e %.4f  %.5e %.4f  %.5e %.4f\n",
    46                dx, Forw, ForwDelta, Cent, CentDelta, Extr, ExtrDelta);
    47        }
    48
    49        return 0;
    50    }
    (gdb) list
    Line number 51 out of range; driver.c has 50 lines.
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The second time we used <code>list</code>, only 9 lines were printed, since we reached the end of the
        file.  The final <code>list</code> didn't print any lines.  That's because <code>list</code> always prints
        10 lines of code <em>after</em> the previously listed lines.  There were simply no more lines of code
        to list.
    </p>

    <p>
        "<code>list -</code>" works like <code>list</code>, except in reverse.  It lists the 10 lines
        <em>previous</em> to the last listed lines.  Since line 50 was the last listed line, <code>list
        -</code> should print lines 41 through 50:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) list -
    41
    42                Extr      = ExtrapolatedDiff(x, dx, &amp;f);
    43                ExtrDelta = fabs(Extr - ans);
    44
    45                printf("dx=%e: %.5e %.4f  %.5e %.4f  %.5e %.4f\n",
    46                    dx, Forw, ForwDelta, Cent, CentDelta, Extr, ExtrDelta);
    47            }
    48
    49        return 0;
    50    }
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If you give <code>list</code> a line number, GDB lists 10 lines centered on that line number:</p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) list 13
    8
    9      double f(double x)
    10     {
    11          return cos(log(x));
    12     }
    13
    14
    15
    16     int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    17     {
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        I'm going to suppress the output to conserve space, however I strongly encourage you to follow
        along with my examples by performing the operations in GDB yourself.  Try to imagine what the output
        looks like before you actually perform the operation.
    </p>

    <p>Other listing operations you'll find useful:</p>

    <table style="margin-left: 10ex;">
    <tr>
    <td>starting with some line number</td><td><code>(gdb) list 5,                      </code></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>ending with some line number  </td><td><code>(gdb) list ,28                     </code></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>between two numbers:          </td><td><code>(gdb) list 21,25                   </code></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>by function name:             </td><td><code>(gdb) list f                       </code></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>functions in the other file:  </td><td><code>(gdb) list CentralDiff             </code></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>by filename and line number:  </td><td><code>(gdb) list derivative.c:12         </code></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>filename and function name:   </td><td><code>(gdb) list derivative.c:ForwardDiff</code></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        <code>list</code> has a "memory" of what file was list used to print source code.  We started out by
        listing lines from <strong>driver.c</strong>.  We then switched to <strong>derivative.c</strong> by telling GDB to list
        <code>CentralDiff()</code>.  So now, <code>list</code> is in the "context" of <code>derivative.c</code>.
        Therefore, if we use <code>list</code> by itself again, it'll list lines lines from
        <strong>derivative.c</strong>.
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) list
    11    }
    12
    13
    14
    15     double ExtrapolatedDiff( double x, double dx, double (*f)(double) )
    16     {
    17         double term1 = 8.0 * ( f(x + dx/4.0) - f(x - dx/4.0) );
    18         double term2 = ( f(x + dx/2.0) - f(x - dx/2.0) );
    19
    20         return (term1 - term2) / (3.0*dx);
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        But what if we wanted to start listing lines from <strong>driver.c</strong> again?  How do we go back to
        that file?  We simply <code>list</code> anything that lives in <strong>driver.c</strong>, like a function or line
        number.  All these commands will reset <code>list</code>'s command context from <strong>derivative.c</strong> back
        to <strong>driver.c</strong>:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
       list main
       list f
       list driver.c:main
       list driver.c:f
       list driver.c:20
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        And so forth.  The rules aren't complicated; you'll get the hang of them after debugging a few
        multi-file programs.
    </p>

    <a name="listingbymemoryaddress(advanced)"><h3>Listing By Memory Address (advanced)</h3></a>

    <p>
        Every function begins at some memory address.  You can find this address with the <code>print</code>
        function (which we'll cover later).  For instance, we'll find the address for <code>main()</code>
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) print *main
    $1 = {int (int, char **)} 0x8048647 &lt;main&gt;
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        So <code>main()</code> lives at <code>0x8048647</code>.  We can use <code>list</code> using memory locations
        as well; the syntax is very C'ish:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) list *0x8048647
    0x8048647 is in main (driver.c:17).
    12     }
    13
    14
    15
    16     int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    17     {
    18          double x, dx, ans;
    19          double Forw, ForwDelta, Cent, CentDelta, Extr, ExtrDelta;
    20
    21          if (argc != 1) {
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        It stands to reason that <code>0x8048690</code> is also somewhere inside of <code>main()</code>.  Let's
        find out:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
    (gdb) list *0x8048690
    0x8048690 is in main (driver.c:26).
    21          if (argc != 1) {
    22               printf("You must supply a value for the derivative location!\n");
    23               return EXIT_FAILURE;
    24          }
    25
    26          x   = atol(argv[1]);
    27          ans = sin(log(x)) / x;
    28
    29          printf("%23s%10s%10s%11s%10s%11s\n", "Forward", "error", "Central",
    30               "error", "Extrap", "error");
    (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercises</h3><ol class="exercise"><li>Using <code>list</code> and <code>print *</code>, figure out how many machine instructions are used for

    </ol>
    <!--
    Answer:

    Using trial and error, I found that listing any address inclusively between 0x8048678 and 0x8048686
    displays these two lines of code.  Their difference is 0xE, or 14 bytes (which isn't the storage
    space; it's the request for storage space).  Note that this is a crude approximation.

    It's interesting that you can't list line 19 without listing line 18 as well.  This suggests that
    GDB sees the two lines of source as being one line of "code".  This is gcc's doing.

    <a name="settingthelistsize"><h3>Setting The List Size</h3></a>

    <p>GDB lists code in increments of 10 lines.  Maybe that's too much.  Or maybe that's too little.
    You can tell GDB to change the listing size with the <code>set</code> command and <code>listsize</code>
    variable:</p>

    <pre class="demo">
    (gdb) set listsize 5
    (gdb) list main
    15
    16     int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    17     {
    18          double x, dx, ans;
    19          double Forw, ForwDelta, Cent, CentDelta, Extr, ExtrDelta;
    (gdb)
    </pre>



    <h4 class="exercise">Exercises</h4><ol class="exercise"><li>There's actually a <em>lot</em> of things you can <code>set</code>.  Issue <code>help set</code> from
    	GDB's prompt.  I'm not expecting you to read it all---I just want you to marvel at how big the
    	list is!</li>
    </ol>






    <br /><br /><a name="the<strong>.gdbinit</strong>file"><h2>The <strong>.gdbinit</strong> File</h2></a>

    <p>Upon startup, GDB reads and executes an initialization file named <strong>.gdbinit</strong>.  It can
    contain any command (eg <code>set</code> and <code>break</code>), and more.  For example, "<code>set
    listsize</code>" and "<code>set prompt</code>" can go into <strong>.gdbinit</strong>.  There are two locations where
    GDB will look for this file (in order):</p>

    <ol>
    <li>In your home directory</li>
    <li>In the current directory</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can put commands to be executed for <em>all</em> your programming projects in
    <strong>$HOME/.gdbinit</strong> and project-specific commands in <strong>$PWD/.gdbinit</strong>.</p>

    <p>You can comment your <strong>.gdbinit</strong> files with bash's "#".  And blank lines, of course, are ignored.</p>


    <h4 class="exercise">Exercises</h4><ol class="exercise"><li>When you invoke GDB, it prints a copyright notice.  Using GDB's man page, figure out how to
    	prevent GDB from printing this notice.  Using your shell's alias feature, make an alias for "gdb"

    <li>Figure out how to reset GDB's prompt from <code>(gdb)</code> to something that tickles your fancy.
    	Google would be a great way of figuring this out.  GDB's help utility would also be useful
    	(hint: you want to "set" the prompt to something else).  Modify <strong>.gdbinit</strong> so that GDB uses
    	your chosen prompt on startup.</li>
    <li>You can even use terminal escape codes to put color in your GDB prompt!  If you don't know about
    	terminal color escape codes, you can read about them <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-tip-prompt">here</a>.  One caveat: You have to use
    	the octal code <code>\033</code> for the escape character.  So for example, bold blue would be
    	<code>\033[01;34m</code>.  And then don't forget to turn the blue off, otherwise <em>everything</em>
    	will be blue.  I'll let you figure out how to do that yourself!  Thanks to Jeff Terrell for

    <a name="acaveatforcoloredgdbprompts"><h3>A Caveat for Colored GDB Prompts </h3></a>
    <em>Thanks Eric Rannaud</em>

    <p>
        According to the GDB documentation <code>binutils-gdb/readline/doc/rltech.texi</code> that comes with
        the GDB source code:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <em>
    Applications may indicate that the prompt contains characters that take
    up no physical screen space when displayed by bracketing a sequence of
    such characters with the special markers @code{RL_PROMPT_START_IGNORE}
    and @code{RL_PROMPT_END_IGNORE} (declared in @file{readline.h}.  This may
    be used to embed terminal-specific escape sequences in prompts.
    <pre>
    <code>
    PROMPT_START_IGNORE is defined to \001
    PROMPT_END_IGNORE is defined to \002
    </code>
    </pre>
    </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Without these characters, at least with xterm, the cursor is not always in the right place when
        using backspace, as gdb includes the terminal escape codes in its computation of the visible length
        of the prompt, which is wrong. With a simple colored "(gdb) " prompt, gdb thinks its length is 17,
        instead of 6.
    </p>

    <p>The fix is simple:</p>

    <code>set prompt \001\033[1;32m\002(gdb)\001\033[0m\002\040</code>

    <p>The <code>\040</code> is just a space -- better to escape it than to have to copy and paste a trailing blank space.</p>

    <a name="gdbinitonmswindows"><h3>gdbinit on MS  Windows</h3></a>
    <em>Thanks Ted Alves</em>

    <p>
        The environment variable <code>HOME</code>, used by .gdbinit, is not normally defined in Windows. You
        must set/define it yourself: (you must be logged in as an Administrator to change the system
        variables) right-click My Computer, left-click Properties, left-click the Advanced tab, left-click
        the Environment Variables button. Now add New: HOME: "(your chosen path) c:\documents and
        settings\username" (without the double-quotes) and save it by clicking OK. Type "set" after
        rebooting to verify that it's there.  You can also type "<code>set HOME=(your chosen path)</code>" to
        set it before rebooting, but this method isn't permanent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Windows <em>Explorer</em> will not accept (create) a file named ".gdbinit" but Windows itself has
        no problem with it. Create a file named something like: <code>gdb.init</code> in your <code>%HOME%</code>
        directory, then go to command-line and type "<code>move gdb.init .gdbinit</code>". This will create the
        file and Explorer will now work with it.  You might want to copy this (empty) file to your intended
        working directory(ies) before you edit in your commands for the <code>HOME</code> file.
    </p>

    <a name="runningaprogramingdb"><h2>Running A Program In GDB</h2></a>

    <p>Let's properly introduce the <code>run</code> command.  Download and compile <a href="./code/03/arguments/arguments.tar.bz2">arguments.tar.bz2</a>.</p>

    <p>
        The <code>run</code> command with no arguments runs your program without command line arguments.  If
        you want to give the program arguments, use the <code>run</code> command with whatever arguments you
        want to pass to the program:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
       $ gdb arguments
       (gdb) run 1 2
       Starting program: try2 1 2
       Argument 0: arguments
       Argument 1: 1
       Argument 2: 2

       Program exited normally.
       (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Nothing could be simpler.  From now on, whenever you use <code>run</code> again, it'll automatically
        use the arguments you just used (ie, "1 2"):
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
       (gdb) run
       Starting program: arguments 1 2
       Argument 0: arguments
       Argument 1: 1
       Argument 2: 2

       Program exited normally.
       (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>until you tell it to use different arguments:</p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
       (gdb) run testing one two three
       Starting program: arguments testing one two three
       Argument 0: testing
       Argument 1: one
       Argument 2: two
       Argument 3: three

       Program exited normally.
       (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Suppose you want to run the program without command line arguments?  How do you get <code>run</code>
        to stop automatically passing them?  There's a "<code>set args</code>" command.  If you give this
        command without any parameters, <code>run</code> will no longer automatically pass command line
        arguments to the program:
    </p>

    <pre class="demo">
    <code>
       (gdb) set args
       (gdb) run
       Starting program: arguments
       Argument 0: try2

       Program exited normally.
       (gdb)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        If you <em>do</em> give an argument to <code>set args</code>, those arguments will be passed to the
        program the next time you use <code>run</code>, just as if you had given those arguments directly to
        <code>run</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's one more use for <code>set args</code>.  If you intend on passing the same arguments to a
        program every time you begin a debugging session, you can put it in your <strong>.gdbinit</strong> file.  This
        will make <code>run</code> pass your arguments to the program without you having to specify them every
        time you start GDB on a given project.

    <p>
        Sometimes you'll want to re-start a program in GDB from the beginning.  One reason why you'd want
        to do this is if you find that the breakpoint you set is too late in the program execution and you
        want to set the breakpoint earlier.  There are three ways of restarting a program in GDB.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Quit GDB and start over.</li>
        <li>Use the <code>kill</code> command to stop the program, and <code>run</code> to restart it.</li>
        <li>
            Use the GDB command <code>run</code>.  GDB will tell you the program is already running and ask if
        	you want to re-run the program from the beginning.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The last two options will leave everything intact: breakpoints, watchpoints, commands,
        convenience variables, etc.  However, if you don't mind starting fresh with nothing saved from your
        previous debugging session, quitting GDB is certainly an option.
    </p>

    <p>
        You might be wondering why there's a <code>kill</code> command when you can either quit GDB with
        <code>quit</code> or re-run the program with <code>run</code>.  The <code>kill</code> command seems kind of
        superfluous.  There are some reasons why you'd use this command, and you can read about them <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/comp/unix/package/rtems/doc/html/gdb/gdb.info.Kill_Process.html">here</a>.  Thanks to Suresh Babu for
        pointing out that the <code>kill</code> command may also be useful when you are remote debugging or if a
        process is debugged via the <code>attach</code> command.  That said, I've never used <code>kill</code>
        myself.
